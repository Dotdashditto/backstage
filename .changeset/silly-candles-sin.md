'@backstage/plugin-techdocs': patch
---

Added the `handleMetaRedirects` transformer in order to support the `mkdocs-redirects` plugin. The `meta` tags generated by `mkdocs-redirects` are allowed in the shadow dom. The transformer handles the `meta` tags by parsing the url from the tag attribute and then executes a redirect via react-router.
